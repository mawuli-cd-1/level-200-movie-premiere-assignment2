      <p class="story">
       The sun died seven winters ago. Now Duskhollow breathes and something breathes back. Something hungry lives in that lighthouse. Something that's been WAITING. Matilda returns home to find her mother smiling in the rocking chair. Those aren't her eyes. That isn't her skin.
The eclipse isn't an eclipse. It's an infection. Every 50 years, the mirror dimension bleeds through. The things on the other side don't just cross over, they CONSUME you. They WEAR you. They WHISPER with your voice until your loved ones walk into the dark.
The "light pact" was never a ritual. It was a feeding. This time? The pantry's empty. Now the boundary is THINNING. Your neighbor waves but those aren't their eyes. Your child calls but that's not their voice. The thing wearing them is already inside. Learning to smile.
Esi's been dead fifty years. The thing inside her has learned to walk. To speak. To HUNT. Matilda and Kofi race against time that's already run out. The mirror world doesn't want Duskhollow. It wants your street. Your bedroom. Your throat. When the sun finally dies... listen. That breathing? It's already inside.
